# Furthest Insertion
In this repository there is the thesis project (bachelor's degree in computer science) with all the code relating to the implementation and analysis of some insertion-based heuristics for the Traveling Salesman problem (TSP). In particular, we implement and analyze the performance of a new heuristic called Furthest Insertion (variant of Cheapest Insertion). The instances were obtained from TSP-LIB, the project is limited to analyzing instances with Cartesian coordinates (2 dimensions). The directories contain:

- Thesis: all the latex sources for the three-year thesis in computer science and the pdf
- ALL-TSP: All TSP instances for the project (obtained from TSP-LIB)
- Charts: all Python sources and PNGs generated for the thesis

Furthermore, TSP.py contains the implementation of the TSP class which contains all the implementations of the analyzed heuristics (methods)
